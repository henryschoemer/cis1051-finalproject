# cis1051-finalproject
The goal of this project was to make a website to create a DnD character, but a surprising amount of the work was simply getting it to look how I wanted. That's also where a lot of the struggle came from, like a case where I couldn't click on an input, and it took me about 15 minutes to figure out I needed to turn off pointer events for the text that was "covering" it. I had a lot of fun learning about HTML and CSS specifically, and experimenting with the infinite ways to align and style the website. While only a little bit of the work consisted of java, I also liked it, despite it being quite a bit different from python. I think what was most satisfying about the whole project though was just seeing everything come together. Doing a bit of styling and a bit of scripting and watching it become a tangible product. Anyway, here is a link to my youtube video detailing a few of the  features:
