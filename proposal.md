# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Make a DND character

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that assists you with the creation of a character for Dungeons and Dragons.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I want to be able to write something for different tabs, for example an overview tab with all the general stats and background, then other ones for what you are carrying et cetera. I want it to be able to be edited as well so that you can use it to keep track of progress through your game. Maybe even a page for a Dungeon Master as well.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Having the framework and the ability to at least list items, stats, and information about your character.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The ability to do all rolls within the website and having options for both players and the masters.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All of the previous features plus some presets for quick creation and it would be great if I could include pictures for the character, whether by input or just allow the user to choose from a few set pictures.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The very beginning will be to just figure out how to get a website to run. Then I will have to learn how to create my desired layout, including any extra tabs, and how to enable input from the user to maneuver through the layout. I'm guessing the next few steps will be to research how to create the desired features such as; lists of items, description of characters, and places for stats and leveling. This will also possibly entail a save or an export feature.
