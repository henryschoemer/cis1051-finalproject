# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Creating a webpage or service of some kind that allows you to create a DND character
Some kind of video game using unreal
A program that tracks baseball stats (or any sport really)

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I do not

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Which of the options seems best? I also have individual questions depending on which one I choose.
